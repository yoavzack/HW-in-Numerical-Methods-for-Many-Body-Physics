# Hello!

This is a small repo for the homework and projects I did during a course on Numerical Methods for Many Body Systems. In the course we learned about Classical and Quantum MC, MPS methods (iTEBD and DMRG), and severla other methods for simulating quantum systems. We had 5 homework assignments, and a final proejct which I did on the 2D AKLT model, simulated using PEPS.
